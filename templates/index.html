          Agriculture has been practiced since centuries. Also, much of the
          economic growth of India depends on agriculture. In many regions of
          India, most of the farmers practice very obsolete farming techniques.
          Grape is a widely grown crop in India. Plant disease is one of the
          crucial causes that reduces quantity and degrades quality of the
          agricultural products. Ensuring high crop production yield is critical
          in maintaining global food security. Prediction and Detection of
          disease play a major role in the field of Agriculture. Therefore, it
          is very necessary to predict the diseases in various parts of the
          grape plant to ensure that a healthy end product is obtained by taking
          necessary actions in time.

        <h2 class="s">Grape Esca</h2>
        <p class="s">
          Esca is a vascular wilt disease that attacks the perennial organs of
          grapevines, producing extensive wood necrosis in the trunk and cordon
          through the slow and systemic development of pathogenic fungi such as
          Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, Phaeoacremonium minimum, Fomitiporia
          mediterranea and Botryosphaeriaceae species. Esca is a complex
          disease, involving various biotic factors (pathogenic fungi), and
          abiotic factors possibly associated with cultural practices. Fungal
          colonization of the wood can reach a critical point when the
          functional tissues are severely damaged, thus possibly interfering
          with the vine physiology, leading to Esca-foliar symptom expression
          and/or ultimately to plant death. Parameters such as type of cultivar,
          pruning methods, climate are frequently listed as factors affecting
          the development of Esca.

        {% elif prediction =="Black Rot" %}
        <h2 class="s">Black Rot</h2>
        <p class="s">
          Black rot is one of the most damaging diseases of grapes in Ohio and
          other northeastern states. The disease is caused by the fungus
          Guignardia bidwellii. The fungus can infect the leaves, shoots,
          berries, tendrils, rachises and cluster stems (peduncles) of grapes.
          If the disease is not managed early in the season, the impact on grape
          clusters can be devastating, resulting in complete crop losses.
          Disease development is favored by warm and humid weather. Symptoms of
          black rot first appear as small yellow spots on leaves. Enlarged spots
          (lesions) have a dark brownish-red border with tan to dark brown
          centers (Figure 1). As the infection develops, tiny black dots appear
          in the lesion, usually in a ring pattern near the border of the
          lesion. These dots are fungal structures (pycnidia), which contain
          thousands of spores (conidia) that can infect new tissue. New
          infections can occur in less than 10 hours at temperatures between 60
          to 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

          Grapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300, and can
          be crimson, black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink. "White"
          grapes are actually green in color, and are evolutionarily derived
          from the purple grape. Mutations in two regulatory genes of white
          grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for
          the color of purple grapes.Anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of
          the larger family of polyphenols in purple grapes are responsible for
          the varying shades of purple in red wines.Grapes are typically an
          ellipsoid shape resembling a prolate spheroid. Raw grapes are 81%
          water, 18% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and have negligible fat (table).
          A 100-gram (3+1‚ÅÑ2-ounce) reference amount of raw grapes supplies 288
          kilojoules (69 kilocalories) of food energy and a moderate amount of
          vitamin K (14% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in
          significant content.

        {% elif prediction =="Leaf Blight" %}
        <h2 class="s">Leaf Blight</h2>
        <p class="s">
          Bacterial blight of grapevine is a serious, chronic and systemic
          disease of grapevine that affects commercially important cultivars. It
          is caused by the bacterium Xylophilus ampelinus which survives in the
          vascular tissues of infected plants. Severe infection of susceptible
          cultivars can lead to a serious reduction in grapevine health and
          major harvest losses. Bacterial blight can affect the leaf, petiole,
          stem, root, shoot or flowers. Look for key symptoms such as linear
          reddish-brown streaks that appear and expand upwards on the shoot,
          darken, crack and develop into cankers. Shoots subsequently wilt,
          droop and dry up and young shoots may develop pale yellowish-green
          spots on the lowest internodes. Discolouration is less common on very
          young shoots, but the whole shoot dies back. Stem cross-section
          reveals tissue browning.
